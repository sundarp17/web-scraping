Mario Vega Alfaro,"I bought this computer because I was looking for a computer for my wife that had: a SSD, at least 16Gb of ram and at least a i5 processor. Also my wife feels more comfortable working on Windows.This one was a good balance between price and specs. It looks a lot like a Macbook Pro, but it feels a little more fragile than a Mac.  She also liked that this one had a full keyboard including the numbers keypad.The Touchscreen in a thing like a laptop is something that I feel that is useless. It doesn't respond as well as a modern cellphone does.We  were looking for a laptop with SSD, but this one also had an internal HDD of 1Tb, which is useful for storing all the data that are not critical to access. That was something nice that we found."
Ben Holcomb,"I am a software developer and have been using some memory intensive programs and needed an upgrade. I have been extremely happy with this machine from the second it came out of the box. Boot speed is incredible with the SSD, I timed my bootup from completely off is about 12 seconds. I am running a data heavy node application, heavy development server, VScode, spotify, and about 10 tabs on google chrome and this thing isn't even breaking a sweat. With mentioned programs I'm still using a little less than half the memory and barely utilizing the cpu. I did a ton of research and this was the absolute best bang for the buck I could find, and would buy again in a heartbeat.Only flaws -Screen is OKAY. I wasn't buying this machine for the screen but I have seen laptops in the price range with better displays.Why is this thing touchscreen? Literally no need."
C&amp;M,"I bought this laptop for personal home use. Mainly internet searching / surfing and using Microsoft Office. I do not have many hours on the machine yet. I bought it configured with extra RAM and a SSD for fast boot, speedy and quiet operation. Overall the machine seems to boot quick and run fast. My one negative is that this Dell has a VERY loud fan that cycles on and off. With no optical drive, I wonder what the chip set is doing to generate enough heat to make the fan run."
P. Smith,"It came poorly packed and not usable as the screen was too dark even at the highest setting. Ten minutes in, an error message that the hard drive needs to be scanned for errors. Scan completed showed multiple system errors. Asked for a replacement 9 days ago and return was approved, still being processed... my daughter needs a laptop for school and we have nothing after spending $700.00."
Scarlet O Harry,"We purchased this laptop for my college-bound engineering student. Price was good, and we like Dell and have another Inspiron with an SSD, but not one that also has a 1t hard drive. We are surprised at how loud the fan is but would still recommend this laptop."
Jason,runs really fast and you can turn the back lit keyboard on or off with F10.  nice screen plenty of ports and dvd drive. shuts down quick this one I have is silver instead of just black. low heat with the computer . nice sized screen very comfortable
RAMON,"Great laptop.  Very fast and quiet.  Not sure where people say the fan is too load because we can't hear anything.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I was on the phone with Dell for two hours trying to resolve the hard drive issue.  The 1 TB was not showing up on the laptop.  After several transfers from Dell, the right person was able to activate the 1 TB drive.  Everything else was in working order."
AmazonCustomer,"So far, this looks to be the best laptop that I have ever owned. Very fast using M.2 solid state drive for OS and 1 TB HDD for storage. The description says ""no optical drive"", but mine came with a DVD-RW drive. Did I receive the wrong model? The only negative is no C port, but that is just a small negative."
